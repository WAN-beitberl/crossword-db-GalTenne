1. The kind of information I think will be stored in a table is:
- The "Across" and "Down" lists, with the same key- the cube number holding the location of the first letter of each word.
NOTE: this table will contain only the clue words for each word and NOT THE SOLUTION.
- The information that each cube needs to contain so the solution will be right.
This table can be built, for example, from a column of "cube index" as key, and a column of "letter"
-the Information of which cubes are black and cant have letters in them.

2. the kind of information I think won't be stored in a table is:
- The length of each word. it is an unneccesarry information in this specific case,
since the puzzle has only one solution, and each cube contains only one character. holding the length of the word will not help checking or assuring anything,
because you won't be able to solve the puzzle currectly using too long/short words.
- The score of the player. It is only one field of information and can be stored in a variable
and doesn't have any connection to the information that is inside the tables.
- The puzzle number. like the "score" described above, it has nothing to do with the information inside the tables.
these two variables can be used TO FIND AND MANIPULATE information from the tables- but won't be needed to be inside of them.
